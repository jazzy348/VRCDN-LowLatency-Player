# VRCDN-LowLatency-Player
A simple Electron app to wrap around MPV to play VRCDN streams without any buffer.

This app requires the MPV application.

This app will not render the incoming video. It's intended usecase is a for VJs / LDs to pull in a performer's audio.

Disclaimer: Although I am part of the VRCDN team, this app is not supported or developed by the VRCDN team. This is a personal project I started on my own outside of my duties at VRCDN. Please do not request support from the VRCDN team for this app. Thank you :D
