A basic webserver for sending the latest version number to the app. The app is designed to not be reliant on this.

I opted to self host this rather than rely on checking GitHub as I may use this for other things in the future.

I have open sourced this to prove what data the server is storing and collecting. Spoilers: it's none. I have no use for the data, so I won't store or process it.

Why am I not just storing a static JSON on a webserver? see reasons above
